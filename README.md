## Chapter 02 - Code, Compile, and Execute

There are three sample file:

    CompoundInterest01.java
    CompoundInterest02.java
    CompoundInterest03.java

Open a terminal/console window in the folder that you placed these files. Compile and execute the first two files by entering:

    java CompoundInterest01.java
    java CompoundInterest02.java

The third file, identical to the second file, can only be run on a Linux system using shebang. 

Make the file executable:
	`chmod +x CompoundInterest03`
	
Execute the file by entering:
    `./CompoundInterest03`
